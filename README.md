# actuator_ECU
Arduino sketch to control cruise control actuators over can for throttle or breaking.

Hardware I am using:

- Arduino UNO
- Can Bus shield
- Cytron 10Amp 7-30 V DC Motor Driver Shield for Arduino

Hardware is not Asil-D proofed. It's just poor DIY stuff for testing and development environment.
Do not use on public roads!!!
